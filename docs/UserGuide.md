| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Words in UPPER_CASE are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.                                                                           |
| Items in square brackets are optional.<br>e.g. `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.                                                                                                           |
| Items with `…​` after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` `, `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.                                                                           |
| Parameters can be in any order.<br>e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.                                                                                              |
| If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken. |
| Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.                     |

## Troubleshooting

**Problem:**

The JAR file not launching even after double-clicking the file.

**Solution:**

1. Open your terminal
* Windows:
    * The default key combination to launch your terminal is <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd>
* Mac:
    * Use <kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Space</kbd> to open Spotlight Search
    * Search for "terminal" and click it to launch.
2. Navigate to the location where "hmhero.jar" is stored within your terminal using `cd`. For example, `cd Downloads/`
3. On your terminal, run `java -jar hmhero.jar`

**Problem:**

The JAR file not launching in Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info" role="alert">:information_source: <strong>Note:</strong> 
WSL does not support GUI applications by default. 
</div>

**Solution:**

1. Our recommendation is to run HMHero application on Windows and not on WSL.

**Problem:**

Unable to exit/save HMHero to data file

**Solution:**

1. This error is due to `hmhero.jar` being started in a protected folder. (Examples of write-protected folders include`C:\WINDOWS\System32` in windows and the `/etc` dir in linux) <br> Please move the `hmhero.jar` file into another folder in your computer and start HMHero application from that folder.
